3127,,South Saint Vrain Creek Restoration at Boulder County Open Space Triangle Property,,40.216,-105.276,"The 2013 flood caused stream bank erosion and sedimentation along South St Vrain Creek, impacting residences, roads, and bridges. The The project proposes to remove and rework unstable sediment and create a floodplain to lower flood surfaces and provide areas for future sediment deposition. The project also proposes to reallign a small section of channel to create a better apprach to the Old South St. Vrain Creek Bridge and use rip-rap and bioengineering to stabilize streambanks and in-stream structures to provide grade control. Additionally, a low-flow channel, rock clusters, and woody material will be added to create channel complexity and enhance fish habitat, and disturbed areas will be planted with willows, trees, and shrubs, and/or will be seeded and mulched.",http://coloradoewp.com/sites/coloradoewp.com/files/SV28_3_OldSSVBridge_lookingUS_1.jpg,05/19/2016 - 2:05pm,1,Saint Vrain Creek
