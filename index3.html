Mature trees and bushes in the existing riparian corridor will be preserved where possible and removed only if absolutely necessary. Trees and bushes removed during the project will be utilized, if possible, onsite within the channel or on the banks for stabilization and/or fish habitat. \nThe focus for the project is not only to repair damage caused by the 2013 flooding, but also to build a more resilient floodplain corridor in order to better protect life, homes and structures in the event of high flows.",

Work in the most upstream sections includes removing large sediment deposits in the original, preflood channel and establishing an overflow channel for increased flood conveyance. Floodplain benches at locations that need additional flood protection will consist of rockery slopes that include amended soils and plantings to re-establish vegetation that was ripped out during the floods in 2013.

		"Description":"The Streamcrest project site is located on an alluvial fan, a geomorphic feature characterized by a propensity for depositing sediment and a shifting channel alignment in response to a rapid reduction in channel gradient. This project proposes to account for that behavior by repurposing available floodplain space for sediment storage and channel adjustment. Overflow channels and a multi-stage channel will provide space for sediment deposition and help reduce flood stage. Bank stabilization consisting of a combination of structural (e.g., log and rock toe protection) and bioengineered (e.g., plantings) approaches are proposed to help stabilize in situ sediment that cannot be removed. Functional bedforms (i.e., pools, riffles, fish-passable steps) are proposed for the channel to facilitate sediment exchange, increase channel complexity, increase hyporheic exchange, and accelerate the development of habitat. Channel gradient will target an equilibrium bed slope appropriate for the site. Offset asset protection, where armoring is located as close to the asset as possible, is proposed for the homes located in the floodplain. Riparian and upland revegetation will help to reduce the spread of invasive weeds and curb the extensive erosion potential on the project site. ",

Streambank stabilization bioengineering techniques and the active revegetation of the floodplain are critical project components.",
