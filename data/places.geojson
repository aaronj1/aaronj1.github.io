The project proposes to use rip-rap and bioengineering to stabilize streambanks and in-stream structures to provide grade control. Additionally, a floodplain will be shaped to lower flood surfaces and provide areas for future sediment deposition.

The project also proposes to use rip-rap and bioengineering to stabilize streambanks and in-stream structures to provide grade control. Additionally, a low-flow channel, rock clusters, and woody material will be added to create channel complexity and enhance fish habitat, and disturbed areas will be planted with willows, trees, and shrubs, and/or will be seeded and mulched.

The project covers three separate areas along approximately 1.25 miles of the canyon; Start, Area 2, and Area 3.  All sites have one or more of the following treatments: sediment removal to establish a floodplain, bioengineering to stabilize stream banks, armored resiliency to stabilize stream banks, critical area treatment including willow planting, seeding, mulching and top soiling, and cross vanes. Mature trees and bushes in the existing riparian corridor will be preserved where possible and removed only if absolutely necessary. Trees and bushes removed during the project will be utilized, if possible, onsite within the channel or on the banks for stabilization and/or fish habitat. \nThe focus for the project is not only to repair damage caused by the 2013 flooding, but also to build a more resilient floodplain corridor in order to better protect life, homes and structures in the event of high flows. \n",

    "Description":"The Streamcrest project site is located on an alluvial fan, a geomorphic feature characterized by a propensity for depositing sediment and a shifting channel alignment in response to a rapid reduction in channel gradient. This project proposes to account for that behavior by repurposing available floodplain space for sediment storage and channel adjustment. Overflow channels and a multi-stage channel will provide space for sediment deposition and help reduce flood stage. Bank stabilization consisting of a combination of structural (e.g., log and rock toe protection) and bioengineered (e.g., plantings) approaches are proposed to help stabilize in situ sediment that cannot be removed. Functional bedforms (i.e., pools, riffles, fish-passable steps) are proposed for the channel to facilitate sediment exchange, increase channel complexity, increase hyporheic exchange, and accelerate the development of habitat. Channel gradient will target an equilibrium bed slope appropriate for the site. Offset asset protection, where armoring is located as close to the asset as possible, is proposed for the homes located in the floodplain. Riparian and upland revegetation will help to reduce the spread of invasive weeds and curb the extensive erosion potential on the project site. ",

Work includes formalized bank protection at critical structures such as private property, historic buildings, and state or county infrastructure. Clearing of invasive species, such as crack willows, is planned to encourage larger establishment of native cottonwoods and to decrease channel roughness and snags near private property to allow for more efficient flood flows. Some floodplain re-establishment and removal of large sediment deposits will also occur at select locations along the reach.",

The project aims to restore 3,600 feet of stream to a naturally functioning system with the capacity to transport and store the excess sediment loads. The project will provide grade control structures, streambank protection, bank shaping, erosion control, revegetation, and the restoration of a natural channel form to include a multi-stage cross-section for low, bankfull, and flood flows.",

The project covers three separate areas along approximately 1.25 miles of the canyon; Start, Area 2, and Area 3.

Mature trees and bushes in the existing riparian corridor will be preserved where possible and removed only if absolutely necessary. Trees and bushes removed during the project will be utilized, if possible, onsite within the channel or on the banks for stabilization and/or fish habitat. \nThe focus for the project is not only to repair damage caused by the 2013 flooding, but also to build a more resilient floodplain corridor in order to better protect life, homes and structures in the event of high flows. \n",
